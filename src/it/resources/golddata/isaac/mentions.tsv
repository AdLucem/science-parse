In the following section we present our modified TD(λ) algorithm, which allows for continuous observations and actions.|Tanner and Sutton 2005	Modified from Tanner and Sutton (2005).|Tanner and Sutton 2005	The algorithm is modified from Tanner and Sutton (2005).|Tanner  and  Sutton 2005	This structure is similar to previous question network structures used in some discrete TD networks (Tanner & Sutton, 2005).|Tanner & Sutton, 2005	This is essentially a noisy, continuous analog of the cycle world presented in Tanner and Sutton (2005).|Tanner and Sutton 2005	We see that the network is able to learn a good model even given noisy observations with an amount of experience roughly equivalent to the amount taken to learn the deterministic, discrete version of this problem, as presented in Tanner and Sutton (2005).|Tanner and Sutton 2005	Although there has been some work on other formalisms of predictive representations in continuous systems (Wingate, 2008), these approaches have not yet been extended to a fully online, incremental setting.|Wingate, 2008	State abstraction in other predictive representation formalisms has been considered for both discrete (Wolfe et al., 2008) and continuous dynamical systems (Wingate, 2008).|Wingate, 2008	State abstraction in other predictive representation formalisms has been considered for both discrete (Wolfe et al., 2008) and continuous dynamical systems (Wingate, 2008).|Wolfe  et  al.,  2008
